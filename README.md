# Vectorscope V3
The big difference between this vectorscope/oscilloscope and all my other versions (V1, V2, V4) is that in addition to the connected stereo points, it plots the waveforms of the individual audio channels in the remaining space on the left and right or top and bottom, depending on where there is space left for drawing.
